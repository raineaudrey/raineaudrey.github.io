                As one of the most influential people in my life, you have taught me a lot of lessons that have shaped me into the individual I am today. And for that, you deserve some recognition. Yes, I know it must be hard for you to see me grow up, leave the nest, and continue on with my life journey. But with the knowledge I have generously acquired from you, I can step confidently toward my future.I am so blessed to have this life, and a man patient enough to wait for me to realize that.You have always been the crutch for me to lean on when I find myself between a rock and a hard place. I appreciate you letting me make my own mistakes but at the same time being there to say, “I told you so” when I do.</p>

                In our lifetime, I believe we are meant to have many different loves. We are meant to have a mediocre love, a bad love, and a rare and beautiful love. We are meant to have all these different kinds of love so we can appreciate it when we find the one who loves us right.The thing about love is, it just hits you out of nowhere. It’s just like BAM! Here I am! Then all of a sudden, you start to wonder where this person has been all your life. I was just sitting in class and then all of a sudden, the boy in front of me made my smile a little bigger, my laugh a little louder, and my heart beat a little harder. I wasn’t looking for love when you found me, but thank God you found me.</p>

                In the scale of preference of love, I rated you one because you always put smile on my face; you are a wonderful angel the most interesting man I have ever met in my life; believe these words I’m writing to you because truly they find their ways from the depth of my heart, I love you! </p>

                Gradually I began to fall in love with you until now I found every reason to want to spend the rest of my life with you because a kind-hearted man like you is rare to find. I so much care about you, my dear love.</p>

                It has been a few months since we have seen each other, but only days since we have last spoken. I still think about you often; multiple times a day to be exact. I miss you immensely but I know this is for the best. It is painful right now because the wound on my heart is fresh, but with each passing day, I’m learning to live without you. I’m grateful for this, because loving someone you cannot be with is both agonizing and tiresome. </p>
